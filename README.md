# Commands for FortBlox
So I have found some commands that could possibly be used for triggering events and more. so here they are<br><br>


== Basic ==<br>
Trigger Event: `Workspace.LiveEvents.<eventname>.Disabled = false`<br>
Destroy Object: `workspace.<object>:Destroy()`<br>
Changing Text Value: `game.ReplicatedStorage.Text.Value = "TextHere"`<br><br>

== Animation/Audio Clips ==<br>
-- Operation Strike Animation/Audio --<br>
CrystalCharge Audio: `game.Workspace.EventSounds.CrystalChargeUp:Play()`<br>
BeaconBeam Animation: `game.Workspace.BeaconBeam.Enabled = true`<br>
